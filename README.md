# Spider-game
## Project Description
This is a first-person game project in which the player has a grappling gun that can shoot out a rope and connect it to surfaces. The player has to use the ropes in creative ways to reach new areas and recover important objects. The focus of this project lies in accurately simulating rope within a game engine, allowing rope to collide with each other and making knots.
